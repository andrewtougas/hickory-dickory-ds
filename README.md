# [BEER] The Hickory Dickory Ds

A web app for tracking results and player statistics for the [BEER The Hickory Dickory Ds](http://hdd.andrewtougas.com) Rocket League club. The site was built with Vue CLI and uses Vue.js.

## Project Setup

To ensure all necessary modules are loaded for development, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

To test the site on your local system, run the following command, and navigate to the localhost URL that is output:

```
npm run serve
```

## Deployment

Currently, this process is done by building and compiling the production-ready code and then manually transfering the resulting distrubution directory to the live server. This process should be streamlined using CI/CD to automatically build/compile the code and push to live server on every master branch commit.

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
